This is the repository for my Thesis project. There are two components two it:
- A mobile application written in React Native for iOS
- A tablet application written in ReactJs

**NOTE** In order to make this repository public, the api keys to connect with Firebase have been removed. As such, though the code can be downloaded, it cannot be run. The code here has been provided for demonstration purposes.


## Mobile App Side ##

The mobile application component is meant for use for the adult children in the family unit who are able to send video messages to their elderly parents on the go. The application has push notifications that remind the user to send video updates to their family members.

### To run ###
- Install the `expo` application on your mobile device
- Create an expo account
- Request an invitation to the expo project for this application by emailing `dylankroft@gmail.com`
- Open up the expo app and access the "Family Connect" app through it

## Tablet App Side ##

The tablet application component is meant for use for the elderly parents. The system is meant to remain in place and be easily accessible. Users are able to access this device at any time to send a video message to their children, or check for video messages from them.

### To run ###
- Go to `https://familyconnect.netlify.app` on a tablet device
- Log in with the email `alice@gmail.com` and password `thesis123`
- The application is designed for use in portrait orientation
